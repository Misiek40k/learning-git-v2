                Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year
                And terrors don't prey on
                Innocent victims
                Trust me, darling, trust me darling
                It's been a loveless year
                I'm a man of three fears
                Integrity, faith and
                Crocodile tears
                Trust me, darling, trust me, darling
            </p>
            <p>
                So look me in the eyes
                Tell me what you see
                Perfect paradise
                Tearing at the seams
                I wish I could escape
                I don't wanna fake it
                Wish I could erase it
                Make your heart believe
            </p>
            <p>
                But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
                Now you know
                Now you know
                That I'm a bad liar, bad liar
                Now you know, you're free to go (go)
            </p>
            <p>
                Did all my dreams never mean one thing?
                Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?
                Oh, I've been askin' for
                Oh, I've been askin' for problems, problems, problems
                I wage my war, on the world inside
                I take my gun to the enemy's side
                Oh, I've been askin' for (trust me, darling)
                Oh, I've been askin' for (trust me, darling)
                Problems, problems, problems
            </p>
            <p>
                So look me in the eyes
                Tell me what you see
                Perfect paradise
                Tearing at the seams
                I wish I could escape
                I don't wanna fake it
                Wish I could erase it
                Make your heart believe
            </p>
            <p>
                But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
                Now you know
                Now you know
                That I'm a bad liar, bad liar
                Now you know, you're free to go
            </p>
            <p>
                I can't breathe, I can't be
                I can't be what you want me to be
                Believe me, this one time
                Believe me
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm a bad liar, bad liar

                That I'm a bad liar, bad liar
                Now you know, you're free to go

            <p>
                Oh
                Please believe me
